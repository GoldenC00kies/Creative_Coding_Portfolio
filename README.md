# Creative_Coding_Portfolio
<p>This portfolio provides links to four projects that I have improved upon in some way for my Creative Coding class. I chose the following four projects to improve upon because I was either not happy with the original project or I felt like I could do more with what I had originally turned in. When thinking about how I was going to revise and improve upon the following projects, for each one, I wanted to make sure that I did something that I wish I had done for the original.</p>
<p>One major thing that I learned about myself by taking this class is that I really like working with images creatively. One of the main reasons why the Glitch project was my favorite is because all of the work that we did for that project involved images. One thing that I wish we did more of in class was working with images and transforming them.</p>

<b>My Improved Poem Project</b>
<p>The link to my github repository for my improved Poem project can be found here: https://github.com/GoldenC00kies/Generative-Poem-2.0</p>
<b>What I improved upon</b>
<p>In my original Poem project, I got a lot of help and most of my code from Professor Whalen. So, I decided to do a completely new thing for improving my Poem project, which was to take the first half of the poem called "Twas the night before Christmas" and have certain words in the poem be replaced with a random word from a list that I created. This new code for my Poem project is better than the original because I did all of the coding myself and the output of my code, in my opinion, is a lot more meaningful.</p>
<b>My Improved Clock Project</b>
<p>The link to my open processing sketch for my improved Clock can be found here: https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1357748</p>
<b>What I improved upon</b>
<p>In my original Clock project, I had only one snowflake representing seconds. However, in my improved Clock project, I included a snowflake representing minutes and a snowflake which is supposed to represent hours. Unfortunatlly, the hours snowflake doesn't seem to quite work. However, I would say that this improved Clock code is better than the original because it has more measurements of time.</p>
<b> My Improved Glitch Project</b>
<p>The link to my three new glitched pieces can be found here: https://imgur.com/a/0Ey023p</p>
<b> What I improved upon</b>
<p>In my original series of posts for the Glitch project, I only had two glitched gifs in my gallery. I wanted to do more with glitching gifs, since there is so much creative potential. As a result, when I improved upon my glitch project, I viewed the new glitched gifs as part of my original gallery rather than their own seperate thing. My new glitch project is an improvement to my original glitch project by adding more variety in the form of glitched gifs.</p>
<b> My improved Screensaver Project</b>
<p>The link to my improved screensaver project can be found here: https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1350239</p>
<b> What I improved upon</b>
<p>When I submited a project for the screensaver assignment, what I submited wasn't my own code, but just someone else's that I tweaked slightly. I was originally going to submit something else, but I felt like it was way too simple. So, for my improved screensaver project, I have decided to showcase what I was originally going to turn in. This is an improvement upon my original screensaver project because, even though it is simple and was inspired by code from a tutoiral that we did in class, I can say with a lot more confidence that this code feels like my own and that I understand how it works.</p>
