# Creative_Coding_Portfolio
<p>This portfolio provides links to four projects that I have improved upon in some way for my Creative Coding class.</p> 

# My Improved Poem Project
<p>The link to my github repository for my improved Poem project can be found here: https://github.com/GoldenC00kies/Generative-Poem-2.0</p>
## What I improved upon
<p>In my original project, I got a lot of help and most of my code from Professor Whalen. So, I decided to do a completely new thing for my improving my Poem project, which was to take the first half of the poem called "Twas the night before Christmas" and have certain words in the poem be replaced with a random word from a list that I created. This new code for my Poem project is better than the original because I did all of the coding myself and the output of my code, in my opinion, is a lot more meaningful.</p>
# My Improved Clock Project
